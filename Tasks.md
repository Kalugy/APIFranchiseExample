## Story ID: US-001
### Epic: API Development
### Priority: High
### Status: In Progress

## Description
As a developer, I want to create the first API routes for the project so that the application can interact with clients effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [✅] The project must be developed in Nodejs.
- [✅] Expose an endpoint to add a new franchise.
